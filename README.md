Tension Pool is a Foundry Implementation and Evolution of the Angry GM's idea of [Time Pools/Tension Pools](https://theangrygm.com/making-things-complicated/).


## Instructions

The first adds a die to the dice pool.  
The second rolls the dice pool with the current number of dice.  
The third fills and then rolls the dice pool.

## Planned updates

- The introduction of a Fate Dice based system
- Auto Roll on a Roll Table if a Complication occurs
